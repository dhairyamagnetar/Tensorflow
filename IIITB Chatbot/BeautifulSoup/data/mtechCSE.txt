The goal of post graduate programs at IIITB is to develop professionals of high quality to cater to the needs of industry and academia. Such education will be based on a broad grasp of the fundamental principles of the sciences and scientific methods, a deep understanding of specific area of specialization, an ability to solve new problems, and a capacity to learn continually and interact with multidisciplinary groups. Above all, IIITB aims at developing in its students a capacity for free and objective enquiry, courage and integrity, and awareness and sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of society. The postgraduate programs are designed with the above goals in view. They include courses of study, seminars, project work, internships, and research leading to a thesis.
M. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering  is a two year (4 semester) programme. The programme has been approved by AICTE.  A student needs to earn at at least 64 credits, with at least a CGPA of 2.4 (in a 4 point grading system) to graduate with M. Tech degree.
Students in the first semester will chooses courses worth at least 16 credits, from the following course. Each course here is of 4 credits.
