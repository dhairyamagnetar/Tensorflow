IIITB introduced a 5 year Integrated M.Tech. (I.M.Tech.) programme in 2012. The Integrated M.Tech. programme is a 5-year integrated programme intended for students who have completed or are completing Plus Two of schooling (or equivalent). At the end of five years of the programme, successful students get dual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech.  A new curriculum has been followed since 2020 that allows dual specialization for both CSE and ECE students. Students in both CSE and ECE branches can specialize in the below listed areas: AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), TSCD (Theory and Systems for Computing and Data), NC (Networking and Communication), VLSI (VLSI Systems), Cyber Security (CY) and DT (Digital Society).
The I.M.Tech. CSE/ECE is a ten-semester programme where the first eight semesters constitute academic course work. During the ninth semester, students are given an option to work on a project or choose course work which will help in pursuing higher studies. In the 10th semester, the student may opt for thesis or internship in a well-recognized organization.
